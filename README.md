Automating Rugby Match Score Prediction Processing

The challenge is to automatically handle user input, specifically expected rugby match scores, on a basic website. Users can enter their anticipated scores for a rugby match on the website, and this data must be submitted to an application for additional processing and analysis.

## Approach
1-Front-end Development: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly online interface that allows users to enter their anticipated ratings. Validation should be used to guarantee that users provide legitimate score values.
2-Back-end Development: Create a server-side application to handle incoming data from the website using a programming language such as Python, Node.js, or PHP.
3-Set up an API to allow communication between the website and the back-end application. The anticipated scores will be sent by the website to the API, which will then transfer the data to the application.
4-Data Processing: Once the projected scores are received, the back-end program will process and store the data. It may assess the scores and deliver insights using various algorithms or machine learning models.
5-Database Administration (Optional): Implement
